# AWS 990 Full File Index

The index files provided by AWS for retrieving public IRS 990 tax forms account for only ~75-85% of files that AWS actually has on hand. This repository provides the same index with the complete listing of files available on AWS as well as the code that created the index files.

The current index files uploaded are accurate as of April 19, 2021.

## Future Plans:

- Provide index files from 2009-2019
- Clean up code. I wanted to make this accessible as quickly as possible and know there are a lot of improvements to make.
- Create/Alter code to allow for regular updating of index files
